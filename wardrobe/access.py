"""Cloudflare Access: Google sign-in in front of the app.

Access sits at Cloudflare's edge. A request for wardrobe.maxboucoiran.com is
stopped there, sent to Google to sign in, checked against the policy, and only
then forwarded down the tunnel — carrying a signed JWT in
`Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` that says who it is.

THIS MODULE VERIFIES THAT JWT, and that is the whole point of it. Access at the
edge is not on its own a gate on the app: anything that can reach the origin
directly speaks to Flask without ever passing Cloudflare. Trusting the header's
presence would be worse than useless, because the header is trivially forged by
whoever is talking to the origin. So the signature is checked against
Cloudflare's published keys, the audience is checked against this one
application, and the email is checked against the allow-list.

WHY THE ORIGIN IS REACHABLE AT ALL. cloudflared connects out to Cloudflare and
forwards to http://localhost:5005, so from Flask's point of view every request —
tunnel or not — arrives from 127.0.0.1. There is therefore no way to tell "came
through Cloudflare" from "came from this machine" by address, and no loopback
exemption is possible without reopening the hole. When Access is configured,
every request needs a valid token, localhost included.

DEVELOPMENT. Leave CF_ACCESS_AUD unset and none of this runs — the same shape
the basic-auth gate already had, where unset means open and localhost is
frictionless. Set it in the environment the tunnel serves.
